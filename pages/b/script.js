/*
Tell me boy. What is the point in this rubbish? An absolute waste of time. I am disappointed with the amount of time you have spent working on what is quite simply a disposal of your precious life. Precious - hah! Who am I kidding, what more could I expect of you. This is some of your best work! You however, are far from my best work. Your mother should've swallowed you.
